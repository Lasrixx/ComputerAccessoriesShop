System that allows a user to log in and purchase equipment or update stock. 

This project was completed as coursework at Loughborough University, in which I recieved a First (94%) for my work.

The system administrator can log in to the system to view all stock.

The administrator can also add new products to the system or update the quantity of pre-existing products.

Furthermore, a customer may also log into the system. They can search through all products, or narrow down their search using the available filters.
